The weights were trained using the CogVideoX Diffusers trainer. Was LoRA for the text encoder enabled? No.  | [THUDM/CogVideoX-5b](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b)  | a-r-r-o-w  | 2024-10-04  | 2024-10-13  |

| cogvideox-5b-fun-lora-bladerunnerv1  | [MoonShinkiro/cogvideox-5b-fun-lora-bladerunnerv1](https://huggingface.co/MoonShinkiro/cogvideox-5b-fun-lora-bladerunnerv1)   | This video LoRA model upload is an early finetuned research version based on CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-5B-INP on a dataset of 65 captioned .mp4 video samples at a resolution of 720x480 based on the film Bladerunner 2049 for 2k steps on single H100 gpu using parameters provided by CogvideoX Fun's DeepSpeed finetune script. This finetune is an early version as we prepare to train better versions, in order to inference this currently it should be placed in a directory which can be read by the predict_t2v.py script provided by CogVideoX-Fun, as currently I believe there is no ComfyUI node for LoRAs. LoRA finetunes can be used on the CogVideoX-Fun Pose models as well, this is not just applicable to the InPaint model which this was trained on.  | [alibaba-pai/CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-5b-InP](https://huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-5b-InP)  | MoonShinkiro  | 2024-10-03  | 2024-10-13  |

We have extended CogVideoX-5B to generate videos up to 129 frames long. This is our second publicly released model, incorporating LoRA into the structure of CogVideoX-5B.  | [THUDM/CogVideoX-5b](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b)  | ECNU-CILab  | 2024-10-06  | 2024-10-13  |
